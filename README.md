Subgraph Enumeration and Visualization
Welcome to the Subgraph Enumeration and Visualization project! This repository contains code for finding all possible subgraphs of a given graph and visualizing them.

Overview
This project was made possible thanks to [Bhavik Dodda](https://github.com/BhavikDodda), who deserves full credit for:

Deriving the formula for enumerating subgraphs.
Coding the enumeration process.
Creating the scripts for visualizing subgraphs.

My contribution involved taking a brute-force approach to verify and explore the subgraphs through exhaustive computation.
How to Use
1. Run the Enumeration Code
Execute the find_all_subgraphs.py script to generate the list of subgraphs.
Copy the output (excluding the last line) and paste it into a .txt file. This file will be used for visualization.
2. Run the Visualization Code
Execute the draw_subgraphs.py script.
Ensure the .txt file from the previous step is in the same directory.
The script will process the file and generate visualizations of the subgraphs.
Getting Started

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MAHARSHEE-SHAH/Subgraphs.git
cd Subgraphs
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib networkx
