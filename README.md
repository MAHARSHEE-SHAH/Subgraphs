# Subgraph Enumeration and Visualization

Welcome to the Subgraph Enumeration and Visualization project! This repository contains a formula and code for finding all possible subgraphs of a given graph and visualizing them.

## Overview

This project includes:
1. **Enumeration Code**: Calculates the total number of subgraphs for any given graph.
2. **Visualization Code**: Draws and displays the subgraphs.

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Enumeration Code

1. Execute the `find_all_subgraphs.py` script to generate the list of subgraphs.
2. Copy the output (excluding the last line) and paste it into a `.txt` file. This file will be used for visualization.

### 2. Run the Visualization Code

1. Execute the `draw_subgraphs.py` script.
2. Ensure the `.txt` file from the previous step is in the same directory.
3. The script will process the file and generate visualizations of the subgraphs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MAHARSHEE-SHAH/Subgraphs.git
    cd Subgraphs
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Code**:

    - To find subgraphs:
    
        ```bash
        python find_all_subgraphs.py
        ```
      
    - To visualize subgraphs:

        ```bash
        python draw_subgraphs.py
        ```
